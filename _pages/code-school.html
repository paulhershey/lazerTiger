Code School had gotten a lot of traction with the Fundamentals of Design content and wanted to build on that success. We decided to create something focused on user-centered design that spoke to developers.'

The kick-off meeting is a fun first step Code School takes with all their courses. We convened with designers, developers, and the marketing team to identify a theme for the course. We pitched a lot of ideas — from a retro oil can look to a play off Mario Kart. We ultimately decided on a retro science theme. The style was fun and had a loose connection to the UX process." -%}

            text="
When creating the outline, I started by listing out all areas of UX I wanted to cover — everything from user interviews and journey maps to task-based analysis. When I brought my outline to Gregg Pollock, the founder of Code School, he said it was great but too in-depth. This was supposed to be a UX primer course for developers. “Of course,” I thought, after going back and reflecting on my own UX skills. I then wrote a new outline that made sense for a developer who may be working on a side project and wants to take basic steps towards creating a better product for their end user. After a few rounds of revisions and sharing the outline with developers in the office, we landed on the final version."-%}

Code School always does a terrific job with their framing mechanisms, and the students love them. The Elements of Web Design course was no different.

Creating the course was far more work than I imagined. In fact, it took nine months from start to finish. One of my biggest takeaways was that I love learning and I absolutely love teaching. After the course launched, I started a new meetup group to help tech startups learn about building and scaling companies from successful entrepreneurs in our community. I also became a much more active mentor for students and young professionals.

The Code School site has been redirected to Pluralsight post the acquisition. The Code School courses are currently unavailable at this time. Once the courses are ported to the Pluralsight platform I will post the new links here." -%}

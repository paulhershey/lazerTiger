goals:
  text: 'To re-establish the Bisk brand. Despite Bisk’s success over nearly half a century, the company had begun to lose sight of the principles it was founded on. In losing focus of its primary goal — to improve the learning experience — Bisk was falling behind its competitors in key operational areas.'

    - title: Faculty Supported

strategy:
  text: 'Bisk needed to build on the momentum derived from the company’s cultural shift and establish a clear and unified organizational mission. This mission would revolve around the purpose of the Bisk brand. In defining a clear purpose, we could succeed in placing Bisk back at the center of the learning experience.'

To me, brand is about understanding how your audience sees you and how you want to be perceived. Communicating a clear perception of a company starts with consistency. Everything, from the site and product packaging to customer service and even the office, needs to clearly communicate the company’s brand values. My goal with this project was to understand Bisk from the point of view of its customers as well as its stakeholders. In doing so, I found that these parties were unaligned. My job was to realign them." -%}

            text="
With access to 45+ years’ worth of enrollment data, my team and I had the fortune to dig through some great demographic information. We also gained insights from conducting our own user research on Bisk’s product and competitors’ products, which we paired with market projections from Bisk’s BI team and third-party research from Forrester. With this information, we were able to create our first round of data-driven personas and were one step closer to creating a user-centered culture." -%}

Without a clearly articulated, easily understood, and emotional mission, the Bisk brand lacked focus. We went on a vision quest with the company president and key influencers in the organization to explore both visceral and intellectual responses displaying how each stakeholder felt about the Bisk brand, and how each would like to see the brand in the future."-%}

After three days of exploring everything from personal defining moments to mind mapping, word association, Crazy Eights, voting, and deep discussions, we were able to walk away with a clear mission statement and three core values that represented not only the company but also the stakeholders’ core beliefs. This was a big step in the branding exercise and really united us in a common direction. Our mission was:"-%}

We built out a roadmap with each deliverable being categorized into a design sprint. The first sprint we embarked on revolved around the logo. Our team worked closely with the president and his father, the founder of Bisk. This allowed us to pinpoint elements that were important to the brand while discussing Bisk’s history and origin story. After card sorting with the president, we found that the new brand would revolve around three key words: bold, authentic, and imaginative."-%}

After running the sprints and finalizing the brand elements, we built out a master brand book.

Our team also created an online style guide where employees could download and access all brand assets. We also started wireframing and building the website as soon as brand elements were finalized. The website* went live on stage during the epic brand rollout event.

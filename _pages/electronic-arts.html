The editorial team was struggling to get timely content onto EA’s network of sites at scale. The tool they had been using was overly complex and not mobile-friendly. I was asked to create a tool to solve the issues facing this newly formed business unit. With limited data and a lot of unanswered questions, I set out to define a product strategy, understand the needs of the people using the tool, and conduct ideation sessions with the end users to ensure we created a tool they understood and would enjoy using on a daily basis.

What we ultimately created was a product called Flux — a flexible, mobile-friendly tool that not only solved the initial issues the team was facing but also changed the way the business unit worked as a whole. Below is a sample of the branding that was developed for the product." -%}

We started our research by mining for quantitative data collected by our Digital Intelligence team. Although we were not collecting user data on internal tools, we did have a great deal of data on how players were interacting with our news content. We learned that the news content on our sites had by far the most traffic at over 3M uniques at points in campaign cycles. We also learned that we had a high bounce rate in an area of the site that should encourage higher session rates. Lastly, we discovered that people liked sharing news content, and this was a behavior we knew we wanted to encourage." -%}

Previously, writers spent a lot of time building content from scratch and sifting through unnecessary components. After learning more about the content they wanted to create, we were able to remove the unneeded components, add in new ones, and organize everything into templates — giving them the right tools for the right job. This cleaned up the UI and improved cognitive load." -%}

Working with media on the platform was important, but there were different workflows depending on when and where writers were applying it. We wanted to ensure accessing media was consistent across the platform so that users could develop a mental model, making complex actions feel a bit easier. We choose to use a modal and divide media into two main areas: content in our DAM and content on the user’s local device. Content added to an article from the camera roll is added to the DAM before publishing. Below is an example of previewing and selecting a piece of content from the DAM." -%}

With Flux, there are three main options for adding images to an article: one full-width image (centered across eight columns), two side-by-side images (each spanning six columns), or three side-by-side images (each spanning four columns). When adjusting using the crop tool, images snap to the predefined widths while allowing the height to be flexible to the content creator’s discretion. If an image is added across six or fewer columns, the writer receives a cue to add additional images, which need to be added before the article can be published. Below is an example of the workflow for adding two images to an article." -%}

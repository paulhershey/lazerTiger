The editorial team was struggling to get timely content onto EA’s network of sites at scale. The tool they had been using was overly complex and not mobile-friendly. I was asked to create a tool to solve the issues facing this newly formed business unit. With limited data and a lot of unanswered questions, I set out to define a product strategy, understand the needs of the people using the tool, and conduct ideation sessions with the end users to ensure we created a tool they understood and would enjoy using on a daily basis.

What we ultimately created was a product called Flux — a flexible, mobile-friendly tool that not only solved the initial issues the team was facing but also changed the way the business unit worked as a whole. Below is a sample of the branding that was developed for the product." -%}

We started our research by mining for quantitative data collected by our Digital Intelligence team. Although we were not collecting user data on internal tools, we did have a great deal of data on how players were interacting with our news content. We learned that the news content on our sites had by far the most traffic at over 3M uniques at points in campaign cycles. We also learned that we had a high bounce rate in an area of the site that should encourage higher session rates. Lastly, we discovered that people liked sharing news content, and this was a behavior we knew we wanted to encourage." -%}

We pulled designers from various teams to ideate on designs for different features. We shared the quantitative and qualitative findings from the research sessions to ensure everyone was context set. We created user stories, ran Crazy Eights, created storyboards, and voted collectively on the ideas. We came out of this multi-day exercise with some refined ideas on features that we could prototype and start testing with the writing staff." -%}

Once we had hypothesized on features and key pain points, we started sketching possible UI views and workflows to share with the writing team. We ran some CPTs (customer preference tests) to see which options made the most sense for their team. We learned a lot in this phase, and with low investment in design we were able to cycle through a lot of ideas. From here we could start to prototype and test ideas at higher fidelity." -%}

Working with media on the platform was important, but there were different workflows depending on when and where writers were applying it.

With Flux, there are three main options for adding images to an article: one full-width image (centered across eight columns), two side-by-side images (each spanning six columns), or three side-by-side images (each spanning four columns). When adjusting using the crop tool, images snap to the predefined widths while allowing the height to be flexible to the content creator’s discretion. If an image is added across six or fewer columns, the writer receives a cue to add additional images, which need to be added before the article can be published. Below is an example of the workflow for adding two images to an article." -%}

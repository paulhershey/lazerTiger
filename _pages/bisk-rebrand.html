In losing focus of its primary goal — to improve the learning experience — Bisk was falling behind its competitors in key operational areas.'

To me, brand is about understanding how your audience sees you and how you want to be perceived. Communicating a clear perception of a company starts with consistency. Everything, from the site and product packaging to customer service and even the office, needs to clearly communicate the company’s brand values. My goal with this project was to understand Bisk from the point of view of its customers as well as its stakeholders. In doing so, I found that these parties were unaligned. My job was to realign them." -%}

With access to 45+ years’ worth of enrollment data, my team and I had the fortune to dig through some great demographic information. We also gained insights from conducting our own user research on Bisk’s product and competitors’ products, which we paired with market projections from Bisk’s BI team and third-party research from Forrester. With this information, we were able to create our first round of data-driven personas and were one step closer to creating a user-centered culture." -%}

The brand rollout event was held at an amazing venue and had a large turnout of employees who were excited to see the new brand. It was great to see and hear their reactions to the rebrand. We even got to throw the swag off the stage to employees. I couldn’t have asked for a better branding opportunity or for a more talented team to work with." -%}
